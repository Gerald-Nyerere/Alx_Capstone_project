# Student Result Management API

A Django-based backend system for managing student records, results, and user roles.
The API is designed  to simplify management of academic records by allowing secure creation of , retrieval, updating and deletion of student data, subjects, grades and performance results.
This backend system can be integrated into the school portal to give teachers and administrators an easy way to manage results while students can access their own results.
